# Nighttime-Lights-Raster-Data-to-Country-Year-CSV---QGIS-Python
This project outlines how to extract .TAR files, upload .TIF Files to QGIS, pull .TIF statistics based on shapefile (in this case, country borders), and export new country-level Nighttime Lights Data to CSV.

TIF Files for Night Lights Data are too large to import. The Python code describes this a bit more, but please download raw files from here: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/dmsp-operational-linescan-system
